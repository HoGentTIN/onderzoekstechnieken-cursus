  abstract    = {Vandaag de dag bestaan er veel applicaties, maar hoeveel daarvan blijven werken zonder internetverbinding? Tegenwoordig is het ondersteunen van offline werking in een applicatie geen luxe meer, maar een must-have. Om offline-support te voorzien binnen een applicatie, is er nood aan het gebruik van een database. Hierdoor zijn databases belangrijk binnen de IT-sector. Er bestaan verschillende soorten databases, maar welke moet men gebruiken? Welke is het meest geschikt bij een bepaalde soort applicatie? De keuze van de database kan een grote invloed hebben op verschillende eigenschappen: performantie, opstartsnelheid, CPU-gebruik,.. Volgende vragen worden beantwoord binnen dit onderzoek: wat is de invloed van de gekozen database op de opstartsnelheid, wat is de invloed van de gekozen database op het CPU-gebruik, wat is de gemiddelde snelheid van de gekozen database bij het toevoegen van records aan de database?},

  abstract  = {Effect size is a simple way of quantifying the difference between two groups that has many advantages over the use of tests of statistical significance alone. Effect size emphasises the size of the difference rather than confounding this with sample size. However, primary reports rarely mention effect sizes and few textbooks, research methods courses or computer packages address the concept. This paper provides an explication of what an effect size is, how it is calculated and how it can be interpreted. The relationship between effect size and statistical significance is discussed and the use of confidence intervals for the latter outlined. Some advantages and dangers of using effect sizes in meta-analysis are discussed and other problems with the use of effect sizes are raised. A number of alternative measures of effect size are described. Finally, advice on the use of effect sizes is summarised.},

  abstract       = {Taking a memory test not only assesses what one knows, but also enhances later retention, a phenomenon known as the testing effect. We studied this effect with educationally relevant materials and investigated whether testing facilitates learning only because tests offer an opportunity to restudy material. In two experiments, students studied prose passages and took one or three immediate free-recall tests, without feedback, or restudied the material the same number of times as the students who received tests. Students then took a final retention test 5 min, 2 days, or 1 week later. When the final test was given after 5 min, repeated studying improved recall relative to repeated testing. However, on the delayed tests, prior testing produced substantially greater retention than studying, even though repeated studying increased students' confidence in their ability to remember the material. Testing is a powerful means of improving learning, not just assessing it.},
