Probability distribution of a population fraction

```{r}
n <- 31 * 24 * 60   # sample size, number of minutes in januari
k <- n - 1          # number of successes
p <- k / n          # probability of success for the sample
q <- 1 - p          # probability of failure for the sample
```

Properties of the probability distribution:

```{r}
m <- p              # mean 
s <- sqrt(p*q/n)    # stdev
```

Probability that SLA is not met:

```{r}
g <- 0.99999        # if p < g, the SLA is *not* met
pnorm(g, m, s)
```

Plot of the situation:

```{r}
ggplot(data = data.frame(x = c(m-4*s, m+4*s)), mapping = aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, n = 201, args = list(mean = m, sd = s)) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = g, color = "green")
```
